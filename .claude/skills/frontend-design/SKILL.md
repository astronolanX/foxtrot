# Frontend Design

Generate creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## Before Implementation

Establish context:
- **Purpose & audience**: What problem does this interface solve?
- **Aesthetic direction**: minimalist, maximalist, retro, organic, luxury, playful, brutalist?
- **Technical constraints**: Framework, performance requirements
- **Differentiation**: What makes this memorable?

## Design Principles

### Typography
- Choose distinctive, characterful fonts — avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial
- Pair a display font with a refined body typeface
- Create clear visual hierarchy

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive palette using CSS variables
- Dominant colors with sharp accents > timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- Atmospheric backgrounds > solid colors

### Motion
- Purposeful page-load sequences with staggered reveals
- CSS-only for HTML, Motion library for React/Astro
- Avoid scattered, purposeless micro-interactions

### Composition
- Unexpected layouts: asymmetry, overlap, grid-breaking
- Generous negative space OR controlled density — be intentional
- Break predictable patterns

### Visual Details
- Gradient meshes, textures, geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies, atmospheric depth
- Context-specific effects

## Avoid

- Generic font families (Inter, Roboto, system defaults)
- Clichéd color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- Cookie-cutter component patterns
- Designs lacking context-specific character

## Match Complexity to Vision

- Maximalist design → elaborate effects, rich details
- Refined/minimal design → restraint, precision, perfect spacing

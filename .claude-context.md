# Project Context

## Overview

Portfolio site — personal work showcase.

## Stack

- Astro 5
- Tailwind CSS 4 (Vite plugin)
- TypeScript
- Static output

## Patterns

- Session-stable layouts (seeded PRNG + sessionStorage)
- Components use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Polymorphic components (render as `<a>` or `<div>` based on props)
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Mobile-first, Tailwind breakpoints

## Conventions

- Clear function names: `measureGrid()` not `calculateGrid()`
- Co-locate media with content
- Content collection for projects

## Notes

- This file grows with the project
- Promote learnings from session-notes at commit time

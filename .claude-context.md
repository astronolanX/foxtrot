# Project Context

## Overview

Design systems portfolio — theoretical body of work exploring systematic thinking and expressive design.

## Stack

- Astro 5 (islands architecture)
- Tailwind CSS 4 (Vite plugin, `@theme` tokens)
- TypeScript (strict)
- D3.js (data visualizations, diagrams)
- Static output → Vercel

## Design System

### Typography
- **Display**: Fraunces (optical sizing, variable)
- **Body**: DM Sans
- **Mono**: JetBrains Mono
- **Scale**: Major Third (1.250) — 14px → 18px → 22px → 28px → 35px → 44px → 55px → 69px

### Color
- **Dark atmosphere**: `#0a0a0a` surface, `#f5f5f5` text
- **Editorial breaks**: Light sections with `#fafafa` surface
- **Minimal accent**: Near-white for focus, no brand colors

### Atmosphere
- Phantom.Land-inspired depth
- Cursor magic and generative ambient (subtle)
- Easter eggs for discovery

## Content Architecture

- `/theory` — conceptual writing, frameworks, explorations
- `/work` — case studies, applied projects
- Collections defined in `src/content.config.ts`

## Patterns

- Session-stable layouts (seeded PRNG + sessionStorage)
- Components use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Polymorphic components (render as `<a>` or `<div>` based on props)
- CSS custom properties via `@theme` in global.css
- Mobile-first, Tailwind breakpoints

## Conventions

- Clear function names: `measureGrid()` not `calculateGrid()`
- Co-locate media with content
- Content collections for theory and work

## Notes

- This file grows with the project
- Promote learnings from session-notes at commit time
